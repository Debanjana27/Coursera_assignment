        <h1>Orbital Launches of 2019!</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h2>January</h2><br>
          <p>1. Falcon-9 Upgrade Block 5 is a liquid fueled orbital launch vehicle for medium sized missions, which is developed by SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.).
               It is a improved version of the Falcon-9 v1.2) 
              launch vehicle with reusable first stage. Both stages are Kerosene / LOX fueled.<br><br>
             2. Simorgh (Safir-2) is the second iranian space launcher. It might be related to the alleged Shahab-5 IRBM and the North Korean Unha launch vehicle.

             Simorgh is two stage vehicle with a first stage of 2.5 m diameter with four engines of Safir-1 heritage. The main engines are fixed, while steering is provided by four small vernier engines.
              Possibly the first stage shares technology with the alleged Simorgh-5 ballistic missile and is likely based on the North Korean Unha rocket.The first flight took place in March 2016 on a suborbital trajectory. The first orbital attempt was launched in July 2017, but failed.
              <br><br>
            3.  Epsilon, featured the SRB-A3 Booster of the H-2A as first stage and the M-34c and KM-V2b stages of M-5 heritage as second and third stages. Two SMSJ ( Solid Motor Side Jet) are added to the SRB-A motor for roll control. 
            Optionally, a liquid fueled fourth stage (CLPS, Compact Liquid Propulsion Stage) can be carried. It will be capable to put about 1200 kg into low earth orbit (3 stage) or 450 kg into a sun synchronous orbit (4 stage). 
             <br><br>
            4. The CZ-11 is developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) with the goal to provide a quick-reaction launch vehicle, 
            which is easy to operate, cost-efficient to launch, can remain in storage for long period and reliably launch on short notice. Reportedly, the payload is about 1000 kg.

        <h2>March</h2>
           <p>Falcon-9 Upgrade Block 5 is a liquid fueled orbital launch vehicle for medium sized missions, which is developed by SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.). It is a improved version of the Falcon-9 v1.2)
             launch vehicle with reusable first stage. Both stages are Kerosene / LOX fueled.</p>
             <br><br>
        <h2>April</h2>
            <p>Falcon-9 is a liquid fueled orbital launch vehicle for medium to heavy sized missions, which is currently under development at SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.). It is techonologically based on the Falcon-1 launch vehicle. Both stages are Kerosene / LOX fueled.

                    The first stage, which will be reusable after recovery by powered landing,
                     is to be powered by 9 of the SpaceX built Merlin-1C engines with regenerative cooling. The upper stage will use a single Merlin engine and will also be reusable. 
                     The Falcon-Heavy is offered with a 5.2 m fairing</p>

        <h2>June</h2>
            <p>LM-11 (Long March-11), is a small solid-fueled quick-reaction launch vehicle.

                    The CZ-11 is developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) with the goal to provide a quick-reaction launch vehicle, which is easy to operate, cost-efficient to launch,

        <h2>July</h2>
            <p>The Soyuz-2-1v (formerly called Soyuz-1) is a lightweight derivative of the Soyuz launch vehicle. It ommits the four strap-on boosters and features a modified core. While originally the core with a NK-33-1 engine was planned, the core had to modified to a larger diameter, when the development of the NK-33-1 was cancelled 
                and replaced with a NK-33A and an additional RD-0110 vernier engine.</p>
                <br><br>
        <h2>August</h2>
             <p>Falcon-9FT is a liquid fueled orbital launch vehicle for medium sized missions, which is developed by SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.). It is a improved version of the Falcon-9 v1.1(ex) launch vehicle without 
                 reusable first stage for increased performance. Both stages are Kerosene / LOX fueled.</p>
